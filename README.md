This lab involves joining GitHub and completing an introductory course, creating lab files, reviewing classes, and creating and testing Book and Library classes with functionalities to add books, assign ISBNs, and implement deletion methods.

this helped reinforce the classes that we used and learned about in class. using the book class: we are building the modules that go with the server and html code, building off of previous things weve learned.
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, pubDate) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.pubDate = pubDate;
  }
}
